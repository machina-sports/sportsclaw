# SportsClaw 🦞

A lean, high-performance sports AI agent framework.
~500 lines of TypeScript. Bring your own LLM.

### Purpose
SportsClaw is a lightweight execution loop designed specifically for building reliable sports AI agents. It connects frontier models directly to live sports data (scores, odds, play-by-play, stats) without the bloat of traditional, heavy agent frameworks. 

Instead of relying on complex abstraction layers, SportsClaw focuses on executing deterministic primitives (`sports-skills`) and strict instructional guardrails to ensure agents report exact, hallucination-free sports information.

### Core Focus
* **Sports-First:** Built from the ground up to handle the unique challenges of real-time sports data and betting markets.
* **Deterministic Execution:** Prioritizes exact data retrieval over generative guessing.
* **Zero Bloat:** No massive registries or config sprawl. Just a tight, high-performance execution loop.
