# SportsClaw 🦞

The maximally forkable sports AI agent framework. 
~500 lines of TypeScript. Bring your own LLM.

Traditional agents handle complexity by adding abstraction layers: config files, plugin registries, feature flags, and massive context windows. 

**SportsClaw handles complexity by rewriting its own source code.**

No if-then-else branching. No bloat. No config sprawl.
The agent modifies its own codebase to become exactly the sports agent you need—whether that's an NFL Discord bot, a Formula 1 data terminal, or a Premier League WhatsApp assistant.

### The Philosophy
*"Write the most maximally forkable repo possible, then let AI fork it into whatever you need."*

*Built for the [Machina Sports](https://machina.gg) ecosystem.*
